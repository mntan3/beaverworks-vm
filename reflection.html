In this program, I learned what the field of robotics is about and along the way I learned the importance of collaboration in such a field. The seminar speakers all brought unique perspectives on robotics based on their background and personal projects. I got to see all of the possible ways I could use an interest in robotics and computer science to benefit society, from assistive technology to military defense to disaster response. Through listening to these lectures, I realized how important collaboration is when working on a project. One of the speakers talked about how there were people with many different academic backgrounds who had to bring their knowledge together to succeed. I could also apply this to the teams we were working in for the labs. Everyone had different strengths and if these were utilized properly, the team would be greater as a whole. 
Apart from the communication, I learned a lot in a technical sense. I had never programmed in ROS before this program. I got a sense of how large complex robotics tasks incorporting many sensors could be split into smaller subprocesses that communicate with each other and that can run in parallel. Throughout this program, my interest in computer science and robotics grew. Now, I'm more sure than I was before that this is what I want to do when I grow up. I hope to see this program grow so more students around the country can be just as inspired.
